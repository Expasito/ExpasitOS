# ExpasitOS
Working on making a simple operating system to get experience with it. 
Currently using Bochs as the emulator for the cpu and nasm as the compiler for the .asm file.

To run the program, write code in the .asm file and then run the script.cmd. This automatically compiles the assembly code into a .bin file and runs bochs without having to open a new terminal
